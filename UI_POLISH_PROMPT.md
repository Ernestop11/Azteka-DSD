# 🎨 UI Polish - Restore Bolt Design Details

## 🚀 Copy This Into VS Code Claude Chat

```
I want to polish the UI to match Bolt's original design details. Some details were lost during the Three.js fix.

What I have:
- ✅ Working app with beautiful UI components
- ✅ All Bolt-designed components preserved
- ✅ Bundle ordering working
- ✅ PO invoice upload working

What I need:
1. Restore missing Bolt design details:
   - Gradient effects (emerald-500 to teal-600)
   - Hover animations (scale-105, shadow-2xl)
   - Backdrop blur effects
   - Smooth transitions (duration-300, duration-500)
   - Beautiful typography (font-black, text-4xl)
   - Shadow effects (shadow-lg, shadow-2xl)
   - Border radius (rounded-2xl, rounded-3xl)
   - Color gradients in backgrounds
   - Icon animations
   - Product card hover effects

2. Review all components and ensure:
   - ProductCard has all original gradients and animations
   - Hero section has animated blobs
   - CategoryTabs have hover effects
   - CatalogGrid has filter sidebar
   - All buttons have gradient backgrounds
   - All cards have proper shadows and hover effects
   - All text has proper font weights and sizes
   - All spacing is consistent (p-6, gap-4, etc.)

3. Check these specific components:
   - ProductCard.tsx - Ensure gradients, animations, hover effects
   - Hero.tsx - Ensure animated blobs, gradient backgrounds
   - CategoryTabs.tsx - Ensure hover effects, active states
   - CatalogGrid.tsx - Ensure filter sidebar, grid layout
   - ProductBillboard.tsx - Ensure featured showcase styling
   - BundleShowcase.tsx - Ensure bundle cards styling
   - SpecialOffers.tsx - Ensure offer cards styling
   - BulkOrderSheet.tsx - Ensure bulk ordering styling
   - Cart.tsx - Ensure cart styling
   - Checkout.tsx - Ensure checkout styling

The app is at: /Users/ernestoponce/dev/azteka-dsd
Components are at: src/components/

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. MUST preserve all functionality
2. MUST restore all Bolt design details
3. MUST use Tailwind CSS classes (not inline styles)
4. MUST ensure all gradients are correct (emerald-500 to teal-600, etc.)
5. MUST ensure all animations work (hover effects, transitions)
6. MUST ensure all shadows are correct (shadow-lg, shadow-2xl)
7. MUST ensure all typography is correct (font-black, text-4xl, etc.)

Review each component and restore any missing Bolt design details. Make sure the UI looks EXACTLY like the original Bolt design with all gradients, animations, and effects working perfectly.

Polish the UI to match Bolt's original design!
